<p id=intro>
Substance abuse treatment has been historically delivered based on the male perspective. The foundation for most recovery programs is Alcoholics Anonymous, which was created in 1935 by middle-aged white men. Not much has changed since then. (The History of Addiction Treatment). Based on America's Health Rankings, the rate of drug-related deaths for women in Kentucky ages 15-44 (per 100,000) increased 51% between 2016 and 2019 (Health of Women and Children). Women are commonly menstruating during this age range. This suggests that gender-specific treatment is warranted because of the known relationship that occurs between the common overdose age and age that women have menstrual cycles. </p>
    <p id=Header> <strong>Data That Supports The Idea That Women Can Be More Inclined to Use: </strong>  </p>
    <div id=group1> 1. Research from the National Rehab Directory found that <strong><i>hormones</i></strong> can help the overall production of  <strong><i>nuerotransmitters</i></strong>, mainly <strong><i>dopamine</i></strong>, making the <strong>"reward circuitry more sensitive"</strong>(How Hormones Affect Addiction). This happens because hormones help communicate messages from the glands to the different cells (Gazzaniga 2018). The study showed that prescribing progesterone can counteract the sensitivities and could reduce cravings and anxiety (How Hormones Affect Addiction).</div>    
    <div id=group2> 2. The National Rehab Directory also found that women were more likely to become addicted because there was "<strong>greater sensitivity to cue-induced cravings</strong> (e.g., people, places and things that call to mind former use of a substance, thus triggering urges to use)" (How Hormones Affect Addiction).</div>
    <div id=group3> 3. In a study done by Columbia University researchers found that the <strong>satisfaction levels from a cocaine hit was higher</strong> in "women undergoing the luteal phase (when progesterone levels spike after ovulation, leading up to a womanâ€™s period) and follicular phase (when follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone are released to stimulate the growth of eggs and estrogen levels creep up) of their cycles" (How Hormones Affect Addiction). This research would suggest the need for stronger recovery support during this phase of the menstrual cycle, something that is overlooked in a male dominated treatment structure. Progesterone counteracts sensitivity because is progesterone prepares the body  to take care of the fertilized egg. This is however a main reason for why women experience PMS behaviors(How Hormones Affect Addiction). </div>

    <p id=Header2><strong>Why I Personally Believe Women Can be More Inclined to Use: </strong></p>
    <div id=group4> 1. After reading chapter 3 of our textbook, it became clear that the development of the brain played another major role in overall behavior. I personally thought of how large of a role the <strong><i> amygdala</i></strong> plays in women's response to stress. The amygdala is responsible for our <strong><i>fight or flight </i> </strong> thought process which leads to women being more sensitive to environmental shifts during their menstrual cycle. This could help to show how fight or flight can create larger sensitivity in the moment. This is because when an individual is experiencing a traumatic situation it can create an overall sensitivity (Gazzaniga, 2018).</div>
    <div id=group5> 2. Our chapter also highlighted the functions of the <strong><i> pre-frontal cortex</i></strong>. This part of our brain controls our <strong><i> decision making</i></strong> and our <strong><i> impulse control</i></strong>, but does not fully develop until our mid-20's (Gazzaniga, 2018). Lack of impulse control is a hallmark of addictive behaviors. Therefore, support and therapy should be better customized for this age group.</div>
    <div id=group6> 3. The book discusses the nuerotransmitter <strong><i>endorphins</i></strong>, which can naturally help with physical and emotional pain. However, when we look at a population of individuals who have mostly had challenging and painful lives there can be a trend with overusing pain relievers. An example mentioned in the book is <strong><i> morphine</i></strong>, which <strong>"binds with endorphin receptors [reducing] the subjective experience of pain"</strong>(Gazzaniga, 2018). When you consider the perfect storm of trauma clashing with hormone changes and intensified cravings, it would make sense for treatment and recovery protocols to be designed to address these gender specific issues.</div>    
    <div id=group7> 4. Although pain reduction can be beneficial in some situations it also has an opportunity to be abused. In 2016, Kentucky was found to be a <strong> top ten state for opioid-related deaths</strong> by Kentucky Chamber Work Force Center (Opioid Abuse in Kentucky). In 2016, they also found that <strong> 27%</strong> of those considered as"high risk" were using their own prescriptions (Opioid Abuse in Kentucky). This is why treatment customized for women's unique biology is warranted. </div>
    <hr />
    <p id=Header3><strong>What Should Proper Treatment Look Like? </strong> </p>
    <div id=group8> 1. Treatment should include tools to cope with hormone inbalances and increased cravings during vulnerable times in a women's menstrual cycle . </div>
    <div id=group9> 2. Treatment should also consider pharmaceutical supports to balance hormone levels.</div>
    <div id=group10> 3. Gender treatment should be expanded and researched.</div>
    <hr />
    <p id=final> It should be acknowledged that there have been efforts in Kentucky to create more gender specified treatment, however the need is still growing. By having the government acknowledge and support the startups of more treatments, desgined for women, we could hopefully see a decrease in overall opioid-related deaths. In the end, showing that with proper treatment we can have a state with <br /><strong>recovery from addiction and improved health conditions</strong>.</p>
